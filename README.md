# Interactive-Soundscapes

Sound designing with soundscape recordings in Max/Msp.

Soundscape recordings are utilized to make an interactive environment in Max/Msp.
The user has the ability to change soundscape, while moving the mouse, and to add some filters by clicking and pressing specific buttons.
The result will be an electroacoustic synthesis which can be recorded.
